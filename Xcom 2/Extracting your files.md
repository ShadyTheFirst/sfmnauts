# Extracting Using Umodel

Obtaining Xcom 2's files is easy enough. Download Umodel (will add link) and open it. Uncheck the "Animation" checkbox as that can cause crashes. Click the "..." in the top right corner and select your Xcom 2 game folder, which is normally in [Steam install directory]/steamapps/common/XCOM 2/XcomGame, hit OK to select the folder, and then OK again to begin the extraction. This may take a while.

The next window that appears is a list of all the packages included with the game, each with it's own prefix or suffix. Here's what they mean:

3DUIBP_: Models for the 3D portions of the UI. Relatively useless.

\_SF: Static models. It's all models without bones, so a lot of props and vehichles. DON'T EXTRACT CHARACTERS FROM HERE, AS THEY WILL NOT BE RIGGED.

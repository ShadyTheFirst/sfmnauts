# Extracting Using Umodel

Obtaining Xcom 2's files is easy enough. Download Umodel (will add link) and open it. Uncheck the "Animation" checkbox as that can cause crashes. Click the "..." in the top right corner and select your Xcom 2 game folder, which is normally in [Steam install directory]/steamapps/common/XCOM 2/XcomGame
